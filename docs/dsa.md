### üë®‚Äçüíª Websites & Platforms

-   [**HACKERRANK**](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) has to be the first platform you should start coding. It has problems in every language you can think of with well-categorized sections.

-   [**GEEKSFORGEEKS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) One site which has helped me improve my problem-solving skills a lot and still helping is GeeksForGeeks, or as often techies call it GFG, is the best portal for Computer Science.

-   [**CODECHEF**](https://www.codechef.com/) The popularity of Codechef is growing every day amongst the coders of every age group.

-   [**CODEFORCES**](https://codeforces.com/) This is one of the portals where the audience base is enormous in terms of numbers and skills. It's one of the most competitive portals for problem-solving.

-   [**LEETCODE**](https://leetcode.com/) One of the websites which are industry-recognized. You will see many software developers from Google, Amazon, and Facebook recommend you solve problems on LeetCode.

### üé• Youtube Vidoes

-   [**CS Dojo ‚Äì Data structures and algorithms**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZBJbE_rGRV8D7XZ08LK6z-4zPoWzu5H) This 13-part video course on data structures and algorithms provides a breakdown of the concept of data structures.

-   [**Mycodeschool ‚Äì Data structures**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P) If you‚Äôre a C or C++ programmer, this may just be the right course for you to learn data structures.

-   [**Tulesko ‚Äì Data structures using Java**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7oRKwDi7wjrANsbhTX0IK0J) If you‚Äôre a Java developer, you may know or at the very least have heard of Tulesko. They provide some of the best easy to understand lessons on Java, Python, and JavaScript.

-   [**Caleb Curry ‚Äì Data Structures and Algorithms**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_c9BZzLwBRLpDEpYRFXKBN-2ZCsAx0ps) Another great lesson series on Data structures and algorithms is from the channel Caleb Curry.

-   [**Freecodecamp - Algorithms and Data Structures - Full Course for Beginners from Treehouse**](https://youtu.be/8hly31xKli0) Looking to learn as much as you can about data structures and algorithms? This course essentially covers everything you need on the topic from A-Z.

-   [**Freecodecamp - Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course - Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer**](https://youtu.be/RBSGKlAvoiM) Another from Freecodecamp is the data structure from easy to advanced course. This is an 8-hour course meant to carry learners from the basic to advanced.

-   [**Dinesh Varyani ‚Äì Data structures and algorithms full course**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Zs6LgrJj3tDXv8a_elC6eT_4R5gfX4d) This course focuses on Data structures and algorithms in Java. This doesn‚Äôt mean anyone learning other languages like C#, Javascript, C++, Python, and others can‚Äôt learn data structures from this course.
